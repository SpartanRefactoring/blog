/** A class serving as stopwatch for measuring runtime of programs. To start a
 * stop watch, create an instance of this class. Method {@link #peep()} can be
 * used to determine the time elapsed since creation, while method
 * {@link #stop()} can be used to stop the timer. Measurement is carried out in
 * milliseconds.
 * <p>
 * This class also provides the means for repeated measurements of the
 * phenomenon. To do that, call {@link #nextCase()} at the end of every
 * occurrence of the phenomenon. Function {@link #average()} then gives the
 * average time of each such occurrence.
