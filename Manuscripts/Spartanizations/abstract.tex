Spartan programming is a programming style 
which tries to minimize the elements of speech, like in a laconic speech.
In the context of code, the minimized elements of speech include 
lines, characters, lines, arguments, nesting, use of \kk{if}s and
\kk{while}s, etc.  
The spartan programming style is achieved by repeated application
of code transformation techniques, or refactoring operations, drawn 
from the spartan toolbox of \emph{wrings}. 
Each wring improves on at least one of the code size metrics, but
not on the others.
This manuscript makes the case for the spartan style, describes in brief 
the three main kinds of wrings: structural, nominal, and modular. 
The evaluation part of this work gives evidence that the application of
structural wrings contributes to the naturalness of software.
