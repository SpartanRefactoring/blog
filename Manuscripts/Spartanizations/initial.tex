The main research question that concerns us here is
\begin{description}
  \item[RQ1.] \emph{Is spartan code more natural than non-spartanized code?} also,
        and more concretely,
        \begin{description}
          \item[RQ1.1.] \emph{Does structural spartanization contribute software naturalness?}
          \item[RQ1.2.] \emph{Does renaming spartanization contribute software naturalness?}
        \end{description}
\end{description}
Yet another question that intrigues us here is:
\begin{description}
  \item[RQ2.] Find an approximation of software's
        naturalness~\cite{Hindle:Bar:Su:Gabel:Devanbu:12} suitable
        for experiments with spartan code.
\end{description}

\subsection{Data Corpus}
We used the ‟Gil-Lalouche”~\cite{Gil:Lalouche:16} software corpus,
assembled from~26 popular \Java open source software artifacts collected
from~\emph{GitHub's Trending
  repositories}\urlref{https://github.com/trending?l=java＆since=monthly} and
the \emph{GitHub \Java Corpus}%
\urlref{http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/cup/javaGithub/}
list due to Allamanis and Sutton~\cite{Allamanis:Sutton:13}.

The ‟Size Before” column of \Cref{table:corpus} provides the main size
statistics of the constituting artifacts.

\end{table}

Notably, sizes†span more than one
order of magnitude, from one megabyte of source to circa~47, the median being
around five megabytes, the average around twelve. The GL corpus was used before
for the study of software metrics.  See~\cite{Gil:Lalouche:16,Gil:Lalouche:16b}
for reproducibility details and for a description of the artifacts' selection
process. Sufficient to us here is that the selection was independent of the
current research and that the artifacts are of considerable size, wide use,
evolution history and, development effort.

\subsection{Burrows-Wheeler Compression}
Compression power is used in this work-in-progress report as a quick estimate
of software's naturalness~\cite{Hindle:Bar:Su:Gabel:Devanbu:12}. The measures
are similar but not identical: Compression algorithms search (and exploit) the
input for repetitive patterns of unbounded length, while naturalness limits the
search to~$n$-grams for some small integer~$n$. The difficulty with applying
vanilla naturalness measures is that they become prohibitively slow
for~$n>5$~(say). Alas, patterns of spartanizations, just like refactoring,
often manipulate many more than~$5$ tokens.

Quality in compression algorithms is measured by \emph{compression power},
defined as the ratio of uncompressed size to the compressed size. Compression
power, our \emph{approximate naturalness} should be correlated with
\emph{original naturalness}, but it distinct from it.

We found that with respect to \Java software the compression power of Bzip2 is
greater than that of GZip. This greater power is probably because Gzip make a
greedy search for repetitions starting at the input's prefix, while BZip2
starts the search in a broader context, as implied by the Burrows-Wheeler
algorithm~\cite{Burrows:Wheeler:94}.

The second and third columns of \cref{table:corpus} provide statistics of
compressed size and compression power of BZip2\urlref{http://bzip.org/}. As in
the study of naturalness of software, we witness the fact that projects can be
very different. There is two fold range variation of their associated
compression power, as there is in their naturalness.

\subsection{The Jack Preprocessor}

Even though software artifacts often includes more than just \cc{.java} files,
size and other data are of these files only. The rationale is that we wish to
concentrate on the naturalness of the \Java code itself, rather auxiliary
material such as configuration information.

Note that \cc{.java} files often contain more text than just plain code.  To
better focus on the code itself, this study employs \emph{Jack}, a special
purpose \Java preprocessor applied prior to compression.

Jack replaces each keyword and operator with a single one byte token. The
rationale is that keywords such as \kk{class} are read and produced by
programmers as an individual cohesive token, rather than a sequence of letters
that form an identifier, or sequence of digits that make a numeric literal.

Jack also eliminates from the \Java code all of the following five: white space
characters, \kk{package} declaration, \kk{import} directives, comments of all
sorts, and, the body of all string literals. The assumption here is that each
of these is not a product of pure coding effort: White space characters are
generated and frequently change by automatic code formatting. Also, \kk{import}
directives are generated and optimized automatically, and are subject to
underlying project guideline. Comments also follow their own style, which is
very different from that of the code, \emph{and}, string literals, at least
those with significant content, are ought to be managed by configuration and
internationalization processes rather than coding per-se.

Jack currently does not remove unit-tests, but is planned to do so in the
future.

\Cref{table:original} presents the compression power of Jack, BZip, when
applied after Jack, and the accumulative compression power of Jack and BZip2
when applied in this order.

\end{table}

In the table, we can observe that Jack typically compress files to half their
size, although the are some artifacts (with many \kk{import}s and comments),
in which the removal of boilerplate material from the program make a ten fold
reduction in size.

The combined compression power of Jack and BZip2 reaches greater values,
ranging from circa 10 fold compression to circa 80 fold. However, the more
interesting measure, the BZip2 after Jack compression power. This measure is
our \emph{approximate of naturalness}, which answers \textbf{RQ2.}. Approximate
naturalness is telling how much the essence of the code itself, discarding
boilerplate is compressible (and hence predictable, or, approximately natural).

Comparing the penultimate column of the table with the final column of
\cref{table:corpus}, we see that overall, Jack reduces the compression power of
BZip2. All five statistics: average, min, max, median, and range, are higher
when BZip2 is applied to the original code, than if it is applied to the Jacked
code. In other words, approximate naturalness of non-filtered code is better
than that of jacked code. This should not be a surprise: there are good reasons
to assume that compression of comments, strings, and boilerplate \kk{import}s,
is better than that of the code itself. If these are eliminated from the input,
then compression power is expected to decrease.

\subsection{Structural Spartanization and Approximate Naturalness}

In the first set of experiments, designed to answer \textbf{RQ1.1}, \Java code
in the software artifacts were subjected to our automatic spartanization
tool, configured to employ structural wrings. We then compare the approximate
naturalness of the automatically spartanized code with that of the original
code.

The results are summarized in \cref{table:structural}.
the improvement in the compression due to the spartanization. It is
worth to note that we have an improvement in any statistics, in other words the
spartanization affected positively the compression, increasing the compression
power. This is counter intuitive, being a small file most difficult to
compress than a larger one (REFORMULATE)
