In \cref{table:original} are reported the results obtained by applying Jack to
our dataset. After removing the unessential code and obtaining boilerplate
code we computed compression power. We also applied the Burrows-Wheeler
algorithm to the outcome of the Jack algorithm. As we can see if we compare
the results reported in \cref{table:original} and \cref{table:original} the
compression power is higher if the BW algorithm is applied to the boilerplate
code.

We than applied a set of spartanizations (partial spartanization) to all the
software systems. Afterwards we applied both the Jack and the BW algorithm.
The results are reported in \cref{table:partial} where it is also
reported the improvement in the compression due to the spartanization. It is
worth to note that we have an improvement in any statistics, in other words the
spartanization affected positively the compression, increasing the compression
power. This is counter intuitive, being a small file most difficult to
compress than a larger one (REFORMULATE)
