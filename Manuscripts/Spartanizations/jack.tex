The experiment is based on two compression algorithms.
The first compression algorithm is called Jack, and it rips off from the file all the code note related to the programming logic, leaving
only the code intentionally written by the developers, namely the so called boilerplate code.

Specifically, in order to do that, Jack automatically removes:

\begin{itemize}
\item imports instructions
\item package
\item comments
\item strings perhaps use
\item keywords are replaced by a single symbol rep
but not identifiers. Take note that it is comon wisdom that the bulk of code is identifiers.
\item same for operators such as -> ++, <<<<=
\end{itemize}

The second compression algorithm was invented by Burroughs and Wheeler \cite{Burrows:Wheeler:1994}.
In its first stage, this algorithm performs a permutation of the characters based on their frequency, increasing the 
the compression ratio.  

The dataset of software used in this analysis is composed by 26 popular Java
projects whose size spans from around 1 Mbyte to almost 47 Mbyte - the main
statistics is reported in \cref{table:corpus}
