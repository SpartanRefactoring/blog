Mention naturlaization

\Java
Software engineers tend to engage  on religious wars on styles are

Examples from stakoverflow, or even usenet... 

A famous example is that of curly brackets around a single statement making
the body of control flow commands, such as \kk{if} and 
\kk{while}.
Mention that \Go forces you to use them!
Mention that are compulsory in \kk{synchronized}, 
\kk{try},  
\kk{catch},  
\kk{finally},  

but on the other hand, in a recent addition lambda expressions\cite{lambda}
the options are maintained.
You can write
\begin{JAVA}
()-> 3
\end{JAVA}
and
\begin{JAVA}
  ()-> {3}
\end{JAVA}
check this.

``\emph{the braces war}''


Why should this be important?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easy to write in  your own style, but how can 
      you always adjust to the style of others.
      Waste of neurons.
    \item Code comparison. Which part of my change is semantical and which 
      part of this my own personal style.
    \item Code analysis tools should adjust to different styles and many
        different ways for doing the same thing.
    \item METRICS: IN a recent paper Gal and I showed that size 
      is the only thing that matters.
    \item METRICS: IN a recent paper Gal and I showed that the notion of 
      "size" is very different in different projects.
\end{itemize}

The holly grail of "canonical representation of code" .
Does LOC mean anything?
Not if you apply different indentation rules.
A better metric is NOT = number of tokens.
But even this is influenced by coding styles, including but 
not limited to the famous braces war.


\subsection{Background}
There is very little scientific work on style.
Mention the Latin quote.

Mention the style guides on C++ and Java. Oracle.

But where these styles a matter of a careful and raional design process?
What were the underlying principles.

Last paragraph: many people believe that style is irrelevant and unimportant. 
We believe that it is.

\subsection{Spartan programming}
First occurred in a stupid TOOLS USA 199X. tutorial.
The point of making and perfecting it was to "be rational" and 
reexamine all assumptions. 
Rules have changed.
Utter despise of backward compatability the need to rewrite the code.

Mention it.  The spartanization tool.

Say that some of your alma mater gang love to do this kind of metrics, but 
no one really knows whether the results are applicable to different projects
since 
\cite{Turnu:Concas:Marchesi:Tonelli:11}


the "Idionsyncratic Projects Hypothesis" I also had a plateau paper with 
Dany and Maayan about this. A number o years ago.


This paper gives an overview of spartanization, future work will be
experiments.

\subsection{Contribution}


Spartan programming is an approach to writing code aimed at improving at
reducing code complexity by appling many techininques, some already known in
literature, some others more novel. It was introduced in the mid on nienties
and it has been a part of some teachings.  Its rationale is based on some
principles, but at the end of the day it is a techninque to pursue an extreme
minimalism code writing.

One of these principles is the "Babylonian Tower Principle": It states that the
number of abstraction levels of a software systems is limited.  A famous study
by Miller, also proved that the cognitive burden people might bear, namely the
number of cognitive items that can be processed in human being working memory,
is limited to 7 (plus or minus two) elements. By simplifying the basic element
of more complex, structured composite component, spartan programming reduce the
developers' cognitive burden.

However, being in a certain sense, counter intuitive, in order to apply
Spartanization on their working routines, the developers need to respect a firm
discipline.  From a certain standpoint, Spartan Programming might be seen as a
list of code style presciption, but it would just scratch the surface.  It is
far more than that, since it 

Being minialized, spartanized code might be less readable that the original.
This is ...  Spartan programming is not directly concerned with readability, at
least not in its subjective and cultural-dependent sense. In fact, spartan
programs will bring much misery to anyone preferring long, verbose programs.
Spartanization aims at minimizing:
