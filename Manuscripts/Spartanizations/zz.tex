% Spartan programming tries to imitate the laconic, terse speak.  
In this paper we presented Spartan Programming, a novel approach to programming 
and code styling.
We firstly introduced the methodology, highlighting the basic principles, then 
we illustated the process and the main transformations (wring) involved, 
reporting also a number of example of spartanized code.

Since one of the goal of Spartan Programming it to produce minimalistic code, 
in order to favour modularity and maintainability, it might result in 
code that is not easy to read for a not accostomed developer.
At the same time, spartan(ized) code tend to be a close as possible 
to a terse, laconic speech. To evaluate if this goal is actually achieved 
in practice, we studied an approximation of the naturalness measure reported in 
\cite{Hindle:Bar:Su:Gabel:Devanbu:12}. 

This might lead to interesting application of the Spartan Programming, since 
there are some finding in the literature that support the hypothesis that code 
with a higher naturalness tend to be less affected by bugs 
\cite{Hindle:Bar:Su:Gabel:Devanbu:12}.
We found that structural spartanization improve the naturalness of code. 
On the contrary renaming spartanization does not seem able to improve the code naturalness.

This manuscript presents a work-in-progress. 
We found this prelimiary results encouraging and 
we are planning to extend the present study by extending the dataset, improving the 
statistic analysis and the set of spartanization techniques analyzed. 

% illustrated the rationale behind (the philosophy) of the Spartan
% Programming, next we thoroughly described the techniques to apply to spartanize
% the code (or to write it in the spartan way since the beginning) and eventually
% we report the result of an experiment performed on a representative dataset of
% Java software systems.  From the results of this experiment, that show that the
% compression of spartanized code is higher than not spartanized one, we can
% evince that spartanization have a meaningful impact on source code (???).  The
% aim of this paper is mainly that of giving an overview of the spartanization
% techniques.  
% In the future we intend to perform a number of experiments, in
% order to carry on the research on the impact of the spartanization on software
% systems' properties, including its quality.
