    LATEX computer typesetting system has been revised to document features now
    available in the new standard software release - LATEX2e. The new edition
    features additional styles and functions, improved font handling, and
    enhanced graphics capabilities.  Other parts of the book have been revised
    to reflect user comments and suggestions. Selected sections have been
    rewritten to explain challenging concepts or functions, and the
    descriptions of both MakeIndex and BibTEX have been updated. New LATEX
    users will want to start with this book, and current users, particularly as
    they upgrade to the LATEX2e software, will be eager to obtain the most
