Spartan Programming style favour laconic expression over the verbose, leading
to a code that is (sometimes extremely) minimized. For this reason, spartanized
code might be less readable that the original. However, code readability is not
one of the main concern of Spartan Programming. All that said, to a certain
extent, spartan(ized) code might look a little bit ‟scary” to developers not
accustomed to it.

In the following, we are presenting some examples of Spartan
Programming % 
All of them are taken from the source code of the Spartan Refactoring Plugin
for Eclipse that has been introduced in \cref{section:eclipse}. This code was
developed following the spartan programming rules since the beginning.


\begin{figure}
\label{figure:first}
\caption{An example of spartan code}
\begin{Code}{JAVA}{Where was this taken from?}
public static <T, C extends Collection<T>> accumulate<T, C>
to(final C c) {££
return new accumulate<T, C>() {££
@Override public C elements() {££
return c;
}
@Override public accumulate<T, C>
add(final @Nullable T ¢) {££
if (¢ == null)
return this;
c.add(¢);
return this;
}
};
}
\end{Code}
\end{figure}

In the code reported in \cref{figure:shock-2} we can see ... .

\begin{figure}
\label{figure:shock-2}
\caption{An example of spartan code}
\begin{Code}{JAVA}{Where was this taken from?}
default accumulate<T, C>
addAll(final Iterable<? extends T>... tss) {££
for (final Iterable<? extends T> ¢ : tss)
addAll(¢);
return this;
}
\end{Code}

Finally in \cref{figure:shock-3} it is possible to see that…
