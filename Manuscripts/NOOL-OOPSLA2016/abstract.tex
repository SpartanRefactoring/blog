% Inspired by the declarative features of \cc{make}, we propose \Reap: a tiny
% programming language in which the notion of a class defining methods and fields
% is replaced by that of an \emph{environment} defining \emph{properties}, some
% of which are adorned by \emph{recipes}.  Properties are similar to variables,
%    except that a property whose value was not explicitly set may still yield a
%    value: \Reap's underlying inference engine applies any required recipes to
%    compute this value from values of other properties. 
% 
% Traditional inheritance is replaced in \Reap by both acquisition and reaping.
% In \emph{acquisition}, an environment may either add or overload properties and
% recipes of some other environment. An environment \emph{reaps} another
% environment, by first making a copy of its content, and then adding and
% overloading properties and recipes. 
% 
% Even though recipe application is caching and lazy as in
% \NonCitingUse{Haskell}, \Reap is not functional. In the course of
% computation, properties may be repeatedly set and reset.
% 
% If properties are likened to cells and recipes to functions that reside in them,
% then \Reap can be equated to traditional spreadsheets, except that cells
%    are named rather than being addressed, and \Reap's engine being lazy. 
%    
% \Reap's inheritance model is similar to that of \NonCitingUse{Self} and
% \NonCitingUse{JavaScript}: Reaping is similar to the standard emulation of
% inheritance of classes in prototype based languages, while the acquisition is the
% usual extension in such languages.  However, unlike \NonCitingUse{Self} and
% \NonCitingUse{JavaScript} \Reap is statically typed.
% 
% Interestingly, \Reap embeds in it not only traditional object-oriented and
% prototype-based programming, but also traditional by-value and by-reference
% parameter passing.  
% 
% Presently \Reap is manually transliterated into a \NonCitingUse{Java} program
% which connects to the inference engine library by means of terse calls of
% fluent API. Usability and ensuing particular programming style are demonstrated
% in an implementation of an Eclipse plugin.
