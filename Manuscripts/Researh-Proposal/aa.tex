‟In God We Trust” states every US currency note. In real life, however we must
trust other agents, our bank web site (to be protected from hackers and evil
employees alike), our keyboard (to protect against government implanted
tapping devices), Until recent recent years, trust was a matter of
trusting software, which is essentially tantamount trusting programmers. In
view of devious, some would say fiendish,
openly publish''ed tricks~\cite{Thompson:something} and those only detected in
retrospection~\cite{this:and:that}.

An new and exciting direction in data security is hardware support for
‟trusted” execution environment. The term ``trusted'' here means a guanrantee
that the executing software is immune to malware, be it as malicious as it can be.
Trust is also against the operating systems. 

\emph{\textbf Trusted \textbf Execution \textbf Environment} (TEE) is a technology that combines
software and hardware, in order to establish a malware free execution environment of software.
One such TEE is SGX, by Intel. SGX creates an enclave in an application’s context, which is cryptographically protected and secured.
The thesis is about adding a feature to the SGX, maybe a feature which will enable input and output.
