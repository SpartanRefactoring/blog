We believe that the new metrics we suggested can provide a fresh take on the field of complexity metrics, which has been relatively quiet for the last two decades.
While the metrics' theoretical bases differ, that is no assurance that they will not be highly correlated to each other or to other metrics such as lines of code.
Moreover, it is important to find the metrics' capability in predicting errors.
We will answer both of these questions will in our research.
